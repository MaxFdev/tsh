This project is a Tiny Shell (tsh) implemented in C, designed to demonstrate mastery of Unix signal handling and process management. The shell supports job control, allowing users to run commands in the foreground or background, manage jobs, and handle signals such as SIGINT and SIGTSTP. It includes a suite of test programs and trace files to validate its behavior against a reference implementation.
